                <div>Metallica the band often considered the fathers of thrash metal.  To my knowledge James Hetfield has writing credit on every Metallica song other than Anesthesia.  He is written the majority of riffs and lyrics over the years.  For that reason his influences are the strongest in the band.  Lars is listed along side James on most of their songs.  He often provides the role of tweaking and arranging the songs to get them to their final versions and is an important part of the writing process.

Other than the first album, James LaBrie has been on vocals.  The fist album had vocalist Charlie Dominici.  Mike Portnoy was on drum till 2010 when Mike Mangini took over.  Three Keyboardist have been in the band starting with Kevin Moore, Derek Sherinian, and since 1999 Jordan Rudess.  All members have been part of the writing process over the years.

                <div>One of the biggest and most influential bands, Iron Maiden came out of the new wave of British heavy metal movement.  They brought twin lead guitar into a new level never seen before in metal with harmonizing melodies being one of the most distinctive parts of their sound.  Formed by bassist and main song writer Steve Harris, he has been the only member since the very foundation but Dave Murray has been there since the first album.  Original drummer Clive Burr was with Maiden for three albums before Nicko McBrain joining and being there since.  Singers Paul Di’Anno and Blaze Bayley were both on two albums with the more well known Bruce Dickinson being on all other releases.  Adrian Smith has been a long time member coming in on the second album but wasn’t present in the 90’s.  Janick Gers came in as his replacement but upon Adrian’s return the band maintained a three guitar line up giving even more possibilities to the sound of the band.  Any Keyboards on studio albums have been arranged by Steve except for Seventh Son which was shared with Adrian.
